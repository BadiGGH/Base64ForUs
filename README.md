## Base64ForUs

At first I wrote this page just for fun to do base64 encoding/decoding locally on my cellphone by an easy way.
But then I decided to use **github pages** and Publish this simple page.

[Here](https://badiggh.github.io/Base64ForUs/) you can visit the page.

**I'll be really thankful if anyone can help me with the *css*.**
If it happens that you liked this repository, a Star would be heartwarming.
